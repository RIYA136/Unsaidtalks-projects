# 🚀 LinkedIn Post Creator (with AI + n8n)

Hi! 👋 I built this cool little automation during my internship using [n8n](https://n8n.io) and OpenAI. It helps you create LinkedIn posts — automatically!

### ✨ What it does:

1. You fill a simple form (email, topic, audience).
2. It searches Wikipedia to understand your topic.
3. AI writes a LinkedIn post with facts and hashtags.
4. Another AI generates an image idea and sends it to DALL·E.
5. (Optional) It posts everything to your LinkedIn for you!

### 🛠 What you need:
- OpenAI API key (for text + image)
- LinkedIn API credentials (if you want to auto-post)
- n8n (can run locally or online)

### ⚙️ How to use:
1. Download `n8n_linkedin_post_creator_named_RIYA.json`.
2. Import it into your n8n workflow.
3. Add your OpenAI & LinkedIn API keys in credentials.
4. Activate the workflow — and you’re good to go!

### 💡 Why I made this:
As an intern, I wanted to simplify content creation. This project helped me learn how AI + automation can make life easier (and cooler 😎).
